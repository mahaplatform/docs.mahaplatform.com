Users: Managing a User
======================

| The Maha Platform allows you to gather and manage every person of your team using one system.
| To manage one of these users, follow the steps below.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Team**
#. Click **Users**
#. Click a user to view user details
#. Click **Access** to view the `apps </users/platform/guides/apps.html>`_ and respective rights

   * Each app will display the message "This user doesn't have access to this app" or :icon:`check` next to the rights the user has
#. Click **Notifications** to view the user's `notification preferences </users/general/guides/account_management/change_event_notifications.html>`_
#. Click :icon:`ellipsis-v` to view the options for interacting with the user

   * The options available differ depending on if the user has `activated their account </users/team/guides/active_user.html>`_, `has not activated their account </users/team/guides/unactivated_user.html>`_, or `has been disabled </users/team/guides/disabled_user.html>`_

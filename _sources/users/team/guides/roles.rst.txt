Roles: Viewing a Role
=====================

| A team can have many users, and often, these users will not need to perform the same tasks, view the same data, or have access to the same functions.
| **Roles** allows to create a role and choose certain rights to `apps </users/team/guides/apps.html>`_ or parts of an app.
| This means that certain individuals or groups of users who all belong to one team can have access to different apps.
| It is an efficient and simple way to keep users in the apps they are needed and not overload them with irrelevant features.

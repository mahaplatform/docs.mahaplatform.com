Users: Importing Users
======================

| You should have navigated to the pop-up tab to add a new user. If you are having trouble getting to this point, refer to `Adding a New User </users/team/guides/new_user.html>`_.
| This option for adding new users should be used when the users' information is stored elsewhere and you would like to transfer it into the Maha Platform.
| You can import users from your own spreadsheet or you can download a template and upload it with the data.

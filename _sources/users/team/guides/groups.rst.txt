Groups: Managing a Group
========================

| **Groups** allows you to group users of your organization together under a leader.
| This feature can be helpful when you interact with other apps of the Maha Platform.
| For example, if you want to give a number of people access to folders in your `drive </users/drive/guides/interacting_with_a_file.html>`_ , you can `create a group </users/team/guides/setting_up_group.html>`_ with these users to grant them view privileges in an efficient manner.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon

Users: Adding a User Manually
=============================

| To add a new user, you will need to have navigated to the add contact pop-up tab. If you are having trouble getting to this point, refer to `Adding A New Contact </users/team/guides/new_user.html>`_.
| This option for adding a new contact should be used when you do not already have their details under another contact - as to not create a duplicate.
| Note that all the fields are optional. Fill out what is known and/or is necessary.

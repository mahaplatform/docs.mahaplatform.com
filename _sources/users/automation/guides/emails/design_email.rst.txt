Designing an Email
==================

| There are a lot of customizations available to create a unique email within the Maha Platform for your contacts.
| Designing an email using the following steps allows you to edit an existing email.
| You will be given the option to create an email in other sections of the Maha Platform - for example, when you create a `template </users/crm/guides/programs/templates.html>`_ or design a `workflow </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ .

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Automation**
#. Click **Emails**
#. Click on an email
#. Click **Design Email**
#. You can add a new block to your email by clicking and dragging the desired block (block explanations and guides hyperlinked below) to the email

   * `Text </users/automation/guides/emails/email_text_block.html>`_ , `Divider </users/automation/guides/emails/email_divider_block.html>`_ , `Image </users/automation/guides/emails/email_image_block.html>`_ , `Button </users/automation/guides/emails/email_button_block.html>`_ , `Preferences </users/automation/guides/emails/email_preference_block.html>`_ , `Social Share </users/automation/guides/emails/email_social_share_block.html>`_ , `Social Follow </users/automation/guides/emails/email_social_follow_block.html>`_ , `Video </users/automation/guides/emails/email_video_block.html>`_ , `Web Version </users/automation/guides/emails/email_web_version_block.html>`_
#. This will trigger a new tab entitled **Email** where you can customize the block
#. To edit an already created block, hover over the block and click :icon:`pencil` and make changes in the tab
#. To duplicate a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`files-o`
#. To delete a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`trash-o`
#. To rearrange the blocks, drag the created blocks around the template
#. If desired, make custom changes to the properties of the Page, Header, Body, and Footer of your email in the **Design** tab
#. If desired, make changes to the details of the email under **Settings**

   * You can edit the email address of the sender and the address recipients will write to if they choose to reply to their email, the email addresses you want to CC and BCC, an email subject, and a preview text
#. To see how your email will appear on a device, click the drop-down menu that shows your current display. Click **Desktop**, **Tablet**, or **Mobile** to switch the display mode

   * You can also change the display for your device as you edit in the two drop-down menus to the right: Change the orientation (Landscape and Portrait) and/or change the magnification (50%, 75%, or 100%)
#. Once satisfied, click **Save**
#. Click **Preview** to view a preview of your email. Choose to send it to your email linked to the Maha Platform, a specific user in the Maha Platform, or to someone outside of the organization, and then click **Send**

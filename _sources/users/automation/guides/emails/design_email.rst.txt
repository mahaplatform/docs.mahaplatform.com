Designing an Email
==================

| There are a lot of customizations available to create a unique email within the Maha Platform for your contacts.
| Designing an email using the following steps allows you to edit an existing email.
| You will be given the option to create an email in other sections of the Maha Platform - for example, when you create a `template </users/crm/guides/programs/templates.html>`_ or you design a `workflow `template </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ .

#. Click the :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Automation**
#. Click **Emails**
#. Click on an email
#. Click **Design Email**
#. You can add a new `block </users/automation/guides/emails/email_design_blocks.html>`_ to your email by clicking and dragging the desired block under **Blocks** to the desired place in the email
#. This will trigger a new tab entitled **Email** where you can customize the block
#. To edit an already created block, hover over the block and click :icon:`pencil` and make changes in the tab
#. To duplicate a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`files-o`
#. To delete a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`trash-o`
#. To rearrange the blocks, drag the created blocks around the template
#. To see how your email will appear on a device, click the drop-down menu that shows your current display. Click **Desktop**, **Tablet**, or **Mobile** to switch the display mode

   * You can also change the display for your device as you edit in the two drop-down menus to the right: Change the orientation (Landscape and Portrait) and/or change the magnification (50%, 75%, or 100%)
#. Once satisfied, click **Save**
#. Click **Preview** to view a preview of your email. Choose to send it to your email linked to the Maha Platform, a specific user in the Maha Platform, or to someone outside of the organization, and then click **Send**

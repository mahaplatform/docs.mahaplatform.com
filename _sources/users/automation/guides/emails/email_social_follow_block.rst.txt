Social Follow Email Block
=========================

| The **Social Follow** block allows you to add customizable links that enable the email recipient to follow the social media accounts linked to the sender.
| Note that the default links connect to the social media platform, not your account. Clear the default URL and paste the URL of your personal account instead.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the email design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/emails/design_email.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

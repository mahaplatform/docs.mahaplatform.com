Emails: Adding an Image Block
=============================

| The **Image** block allows you to add an image to your email.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the email design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/emails/design_email.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Place an **Image** block in your email where desired
#. Click **Choose Image** and `upload </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_upload_a_file.html>`_ your desired image
#. Alternatively, you can enter the URL of the image under **Link**
#. Click the checkbox entitled **Show Caption** to add a text block that will appear with the image

   * Enter the caption text
   * You can use `tokens </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/tokens.html>`_ in your caption and customize the text using the icons in the first row
#. If desired, change the properties of the image under the **Style** tab
#. If desired, change the position of the image under the **Settings** tab

   * Select **Top**, **Bottom**, **Left**, or **Right**
   * This option is really only useful when you have opted to display a caption. The image will be positioned relative to this block of text
#. Click **Done**

Workflows: Adding a Play Recording Block
========================================

| The **Play Recording** block is only available when designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_ or when managing a workflow for a `phone number </users/phone/guides/numbers/phone_numbers.html>`_
| This block allows you to play a more personal experience for callers/recipients - who will hear a message from a pre-recorded human voice.

#. Place a **Play Recording** block in your workflow where desired
#. Click **Choose or record an audio file**
#. You can either `upload </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_upload_a_file.html>`_ an existing audio file or record your own with one of the two options below

   * `Microphone </users/automation/guides/workflows/play_recording_microphone.html>`_
   * `Phone Call </users/automation/guides/workflows/play_recording_phone_call.html>`_
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** and **Play recording** to hear your audio recording

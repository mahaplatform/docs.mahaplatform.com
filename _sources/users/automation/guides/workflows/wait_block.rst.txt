Workflows: Adding a Wait Block
==============================

| The **Wait** block allows an event to be triggered on a schedule - either upon a certain date or time, or once a designated amount of time has lapsed.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place a **Wait** block in your workflow where desired
#. Select to wait using one of the two options:

   #. Opt to wait **Until a specific date and time**

      * Select a date
      * Enter a time (will format to standard time and default to AM unless specified)
   #. Opt to wait **For a specific duration of time**
   
      * Enter the duration in days, hours, and/or minutes
#. Click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** to display scheduled time or time period

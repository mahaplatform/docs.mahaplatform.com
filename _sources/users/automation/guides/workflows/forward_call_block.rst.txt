Workflows: Adding a Forward Call Block
======================================

| The **Forward Call** block is only available when designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_ or when managing a workflow for a `phone number </users/phone/guides/numbers/phone_numbers.html>`_.
| This block allows you to play a message informing callers/recipients the call is being forwarded (to the first recipient to answer).

#. Place a **Forward Call** block in your workflow where desired
#. Click `Speak text </users/automation/guides/workflows/speak_text_block.html>`_

   * Use the greeting "Connecting you to..." or write your own
#. Alternatively, click `Play an audio file </users/automation/guides/workflows/play_recording_block.html>`_
#. You can can also click **No announcement** to play no message before forwarding to the recipient
#. Click **Add Recipient**
#. Click **Dial a user**
#. Click **Choose a User** and select a user
#. Alternatively, click **Dial a phone number**
#. Enter a phone number
#. Click **Add** to add the recipient
#. If desired, click **Add Recipient** again

   * All added recipients will be called when an incoming call is routed to their extension - the call will be forwarded to the first recipient to answer

Update Lists
============

| The **Update Lists** block allows you add or remove contacts from a list.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place an **Update Lists** block in your workflow where desired
#. Select **Add to list** or **Remove from list**
#. Click **Choose a list**
#. Select an existing list
#. Alternatively, click **Add New** to create a new `list </users/crm/guides/programs/lists.html>`_ (this list will automatically be chosen)
#. Click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** to display the list that will be updated and if a contact will be added/removed

Workflows: Adding a Send Email Block
====================================

| The **Send Email** block allows you to send an email to a contact's email address.
| This block is used to send a notification to the contact enrolled in the workflow via email. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_internal_email_block.html>`_ to notify someone internally (within your organization).
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

Workflows: Adding a Speak Text Block
====================================

| The **Speak Text** block is only available when designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_ or when managing a workflow for a `phone number </users/phone/guides/numbers/phone_numbers.html>`_.
| This block allows you to play a spoken message using only text.
| You can customize the voice by gender and accent (EN = English (currently the only language available), AU = Australian, GB = British, US = American).

#. Place a **Speak Text** block in your workflow where desired
#. Click the drop-down menu and select the name of the voice you want
#. Enter a message
#. Click :icon:`volume-up` **Speak Text** to hear your audio
#. When satisfied, click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** and **Play text** to hear your audio

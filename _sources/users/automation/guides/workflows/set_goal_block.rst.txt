Set Goal Workflow Block
=======================

| The **Set Goal** block allows you to mark a specific point in the workflow.
| When a contact reaches this set goal, it will be recorded and displayed in the performance tab - as a contact that has been "converted."
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/emails/design_email.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

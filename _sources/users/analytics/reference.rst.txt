Sessions
--------
Sessions enable you to track separate occasions that a user interact with a
tracked target. When a user visits a website, opens an app, interacts with a
connected device, they begin a session. This session is active for as long as
the user engages with the tracked target. The session ends 30 minutes after the
last received event from the tracked target.

Events
--------
During a session a user will generate one or more events.

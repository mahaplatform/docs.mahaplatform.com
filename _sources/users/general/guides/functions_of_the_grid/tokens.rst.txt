Tokens
======

| A token allows the Maha Platform to record and retain a piece of information about a contact as they make their way through a workflow.
| Retaining the knowledge of local properties of a contact allows you to create personalized communication with a client when you interact with them - through an email, a form, etc.
| For example, you can insert the token **<%- contact.full_name %>** in an email introduction:
| When a recipient (whose full name is already stored in the Maha Platform or who has provided this data previously in a workflow, form, etc.) views this email, it will appear as "Dear **John Doe**,".
| You can use tokens for most text fields. If tokens are available, you will see a small text below the field that reads **you can use these tokens**.
| Text fields will have contact tokens available. In addition to contact tokens, there are many other types of tokens available depending on aspects such as properties like response tokens, payment tokens, email tokens, and program tokens.
| Tokens can be recorded in a number of ways - manually entered as `properties </users/crm/guides/programs/properties.html>`_ when you `add a contact </users/crm/guides/contacts/add_contact.html>`_ or `import contacts </users/crm/guides/contacts/import_contacts.html>`_ from a spreadsheet, `set variables </users/automation/guides/workflows/set_variable.html>`_ in a workflow, and more.

Criteria Options
================

| The filter feature allows you to carefully curate the results shown. One of the ways it does this is using filter criteria options.
| Users will be given this option when creating an `AND </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/filter_and.html>`_ or an `OR </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/filter_or.html>`_ conditional. Click on the hyperlinks if you are having trouble navigating to the criteria options pop-up.
| Below the filter criteria options are defined.

* Equals: Results shown will match the word or number you have entered (eg. a users name)
* Does not equal: Results that match or contain the word or number you have entered will not be shown
* Contains: Results shown will contain the character string you have entered (eg. the string is part of a users email)
* Does not contain: Results that contain the character string you have entered will not be shown
* Is known: Results shown are ones that have been given the aspect option (eg. there is a phone number associated with a contact)
* Is not known: Results shown are ones that have not been given the aspect option (eg. contact has no phone number associated with their account)

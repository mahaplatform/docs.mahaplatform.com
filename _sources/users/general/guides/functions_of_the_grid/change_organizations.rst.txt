Functions of the Grid: Switching Teams
======================================

| Some users may be a member of more than one team.
| Most apps of the Maha Platform contain records specific to the associated team, so you must switch to another team to view its data.
| To make this switch, follow the steps below.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. If your current team name is not displayed, click :icon:`angle-left` until your team name is shown
#. Click on your current team
#. Click the team to which you would like to switch

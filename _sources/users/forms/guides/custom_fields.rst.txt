Forms: Custom Fields Defined
============================

| Like `Contact Fields </users/form/guides/contact_fields.html>`_, these fields are used to collect data from an individual who responds to a form.
| However, custom fields belong to the form as opposed to the contact, so if a field response differs from an existing contact property, the form submission will NOT trigger the contact to update.

#. **ADDRESS FIELD**: Respondent enters address
#. **CHECKBOX**: Respondent selects a checkbox if it applies to them
#. **CHECKBOXES**: Respondent selects checkboxes that apply to them
#. **DATE FIELD**: Respondent selects date
#. **DROP DOWN**: Respondent clicks a drop-down menu and selects best option
#. **FILE UPLOAD**: Respondent uploads a file from their device
#. **HIDDEN FIELD**: A means of including data in a form that a respondent can not see or modify
#. **INSTRUCTIONS**: Displays a textfield, can be used to instruct
#. **MONEY FIELD**: Respondent enters an amount in dollars
#. **PHONE FIELD**: Respondent enters a phone number (will format to 123-456-7890)
#. **RADIO GROUP**: Respondent will be forced to select ONE of the options
#. **TEXT AREA**: Respondent enters text (use for fields for which you expect longer responses - respondents will be able to see all of text at once)
#. **TEXT FIELD**: Respondent enters text (use for fields for which you expect shorter responses)
#. **TIME FIELD**: Respondent enters a time (will format to standard time and default to AM unless specified)

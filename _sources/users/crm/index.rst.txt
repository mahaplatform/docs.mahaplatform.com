CRM
===

The CRM app is a clearinghouse for all of your organization's contacts. From
customers to colleagues to partners, every person your organization interacts
with should have a record in the CRM. The CRM tracks your interactions with
each contact, creating a institutional memory of each contacts history of
engagement with your organization.

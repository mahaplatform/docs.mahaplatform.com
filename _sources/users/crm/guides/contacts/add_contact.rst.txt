Adding a Contact
================

| To add a new contact, you will need to have navigated to the add contact pop-up tab. If you are having trouble getting to this point, refer to `Adding A New Contact </users/crm/guides/contacts/add_a_new_contact.html>`_
| This option for adding a new contact should be used when you do not already have their details under another contact - as to not create a duplicate.
| Note that all the fields are optional. Fill out what is known and/or is necessary.

#. Click **Add Contact**
#. Fill out the core properties: first name, last name, email, phone, mailing address, organization, job title, a photo birthday, and spouse.
#. Click the properties below that are applicable to the contact and fill out the fields
#. Click **Lists** and select the lists to which the contact will belong (this means when they want to connect with their contacts, this contact will be included in their list)
#. Click **Topics** and select the topics to which the contact will belong
#. Click **Save**

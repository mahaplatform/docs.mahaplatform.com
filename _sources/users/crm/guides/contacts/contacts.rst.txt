Contacts: Interacting with a Contact
====================================

| **Contacts** keeps a record of all the people who have been added or imported by someone belonging to an organization. Contacts will also be added to the CRM when the contact provides their information - for example, by filling out a form for an event.
| In addition to their name, personal information, and contact information, the CRM shows an audit trail which keeps track of all interactions with the contact.
| Each contact also displays four elements, defined below.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **CRM**
#. Click **Contacts**
#. Click a contact to view their contact information, as well as four elements:

   * Timeline: A record of all interactions with the contact. This begins with the contacts creation/importation and includes everything after from receiving email campaigns to registering for event
   * Consent: Displays a list of all programs. Click on each program to see the email with which it is associated and the consent status. To change this, click **Opt In** or **Opt Out**. This will inform the program's ability to contact you
   * Channels: Keeps a record of the interactions between a program and the contact (there will only be records if the contact has consented to being contacted (ie. **Opted In**)). Click on a program to view these interactions and click on the interaction to view the message/email along with the status (eg. delivered)
   * Properties: Shows relationship between programs and contact. Click on each program and view properties for **Lists** and **Topics** (eg. program participants)

Contacts: Interacting with a Contact
====================================

| **Contacts** keeps a record of all the people who have been added or imported by someone belonging to your team. 
| Contacts will also be added to the CRM when the contact provides their information - for example, by filling out a form for an event.
| In addition to their name, personal information, and contact information, the CRM shows an audit trail which keeps track of all interactions with the contact.
| Each contact also displays four elements, defined below.

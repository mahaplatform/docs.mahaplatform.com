Events: Managing Campaigns
==========================

| **Campaigns** displays the campaigns associated with an event.
| These campaigns can be sent before (e.g. as a reminder of the time or as a notification of a location change) or after an event (e.g. as a thank you for attending the event).
| To view this feature, you must have navigated to an event. Refer to `Events </users/events/guides/events/events.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

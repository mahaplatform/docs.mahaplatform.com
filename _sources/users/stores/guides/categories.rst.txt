Stores: Managing the Categories of a Store
==========================================

|
| Each row has a category name and the number of products in the category.
| To manage the categories of a store, you will need to have navigated to the store. Refer `here </users/stores/guides/managing_a_store.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Click :icon:`sitemap` **Categories**
#. Click :icon:`plus` to create a new category

   * Enter a category title
   * Click **Save**
#. Click :icon:`ellipsis-h` and **Edit Category** to `edit </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_edit.html>`_ the category title
#. Click :icon:`ellipsis-h`, **Delete Category**, and **Yes** to delete a category

   * The products in the deleted category (if it was the only selected category) will now only be seen when a customer views **all** the products unless you `edit </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_edit.html>`_ the `product's categories </users/stores/guides/products.html>`_

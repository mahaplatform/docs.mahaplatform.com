Stores: Viewing a Cart of a Customer of a Store
===============================================

| Once the `cart life </users/stores/guides/create_a_store.html>`_ of a cart has expired, a previously **Active** cart will be considered **Abandoned**. Carts are sorted into these two categories of active and abandoned.
| Each cart is assigned a unique 10-character string of letters and digits. This string is shown when the carts are displayed - not a customer's name. Refer to </users/store/guides/orders.html>`_ for these details.
| The time until/since expiration of the cart is displayed, as well as total items in the cart.
| Displayed inside each cart are the products, the quantity of products, and the price per item.
| To manage the carts, you will need to have navigated to the store. Refer `here </users/stores/guides/managing_a_store.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

Stores: Selecting the Shipping Strategy for a Product
=====================================================

| If you are shipping a physical product, you may want to charge customers a shipping fee.
| Currently, you have two options for pricing shipping - no fee or a flat shipping fee.
| If you would like to have different fees for different versions of your product (e.g. charge according to product weight), you will need to make `variants </users/stores/guides/product_variants.html>`_ of the product.
| To select the shipping strategy for a product, you will need to create a new product or edit the variant(s) of an already existing product. Refer to `Adding a Product to a Store </users/stores/guides/products.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

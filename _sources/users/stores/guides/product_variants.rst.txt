Store: Adding Product Variants
==============================

| A product can vary in a number of ways - for example, in color or size.
| These properties make a version unique from other variants of the product. This can be expressed when you are creating a product through **Variants**.
| To add variants of a product, you will need to create a new product (you are not able to retroactively add variants). Refer `here </users/stores/guides/products.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Select **There are multiple variants of this product with different options (color, size, etc)**
#. Click **+ Add Option**
#. Enter a title (e.g. Color)
#. Enter the values and enter each by pressing the return key, the tab key, or "," (e.g. Red, Green, Blue, White, Black)
#. Click **Done**
#. Repeat steps for all desired variants
#. Click :icon:`pencil` to `edit </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_edit.html>`_ a product variant
#. Click :icon:`times` to delete a product variant

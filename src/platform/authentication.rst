Authentication
==============
The Maha Platform provides several forms of authentication, depending on your
email domain and security needs.

Cornell Two Factor Authentication
---------------------------------
Any account with an email ending in 'cornell.edu' will be forwarded to Cornell's
two-factor authentication system. After successfully signing in, the user will
be redirected to their default team's dashboard.

Maha Password Authentication
----------------------------
For accounts that don't end in 'cornell.edu' (gmail.com for example), users
will be asked to create and manage a Maha password.

Maha Two Factor Authentication
------------------------------
For extra security, no Cornell users can enable two factor authentication for
their account in which they will be sent an access code after successfully
authenticating with their Maha password.

Forms: Designing a Form
=======================

| Forms can be as simple or complex as you want, depending on how you design it.
| A form can be customized with `contact </users/forms/guides/contact_fields.html>`_ and `custom fields </users/forms/guides/custom_fields.html>`_

#. You can add a new field to your form by clicking and dragging the desired field under **Form** to the desired place in the form

   * To rearrange the fields, drag the created fields around the form
   * You can choose between `Contact Fields </users/forms/guides/contact_fields.html>`_ or `Custom Fields </users/forms/guides/custom_fields.html>`_
#. This will trigger a new tab where you can customize the field

   * Enter the name of the field
   * Enter the label of the field
   * Enter the field instructions
   * Enter the field placeholder
   * Click the checkbox entitled **This field is required** if you want all responders to fill out this field
   * Click **Done**
#. To edit an already created field, hover over the field and click :icon:`pencil` and make changes in the tab
#. To duplicate a field, hover over the field and click :icon:`files-o`
#. To delete a field, hover over the field and click :icon:`trash-o`
#. To see how your form will appear on a device, click the drop-down menu that shows your current display. Click **Desktop**, **Tablet**, or **Mobile** to switch the display mode

   * You can also change the display for your device as you edit in the two drop-down menus to the right: Change the orientation (Landscape and Portrait) and/or change the magnification (50%, 75%, or 100%)
#. Once satisfied, click **Save**
#. Click **Preview** to view a preview of your email. Choose to send it to your email linked to the Maha Platform, a specific user in the Maha Platform, or to someone outside of the organization, and then click **Send**

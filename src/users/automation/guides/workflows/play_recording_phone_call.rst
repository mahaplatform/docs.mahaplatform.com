Workflows: Recording Audio with a Phone Call
============================================

| When you are designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_ , you can add a `Play Audio block </users/automation/guides/workflows/play_recording_block.html>`_
| The **Play Recording** block gives you the option to record audio.
| One of the ways you can do this is by answering a phone call and recording your voice, as described below.

#. Click **Phone Call**
#. By default, it will call the number associated with your contact in the Maha Platform

   * If desired, click :icon:`times` to delete and enter a different number
#. Click **Call**
#. Answer the call on your phone

   * You will record your message
   * Press # when you are finished
   * Your audio recording will be played back
   * If you would like to record again, press 2 and repeat steps
   * Once satisfied, press 1
#. Your audio recording will now be available in your workflow
#. To listen to your audio recording, click :icon:`play`
#. To adjust your volume, hover over :icon:`volume-up` and click or drag the sliding scale to desired volume level

   * Click :icon:`volume-up` to mute sound entirely
#. To record again, you will have to delete your current audio recording, by clicking :icon:`times` and repeating previous steps

Workflows: Adding an Update Topics Block
========================================

| The **Update Topics** block allows you to add or remove contacts from a topic.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place an **Update Topics** block in your workflow where desired
#. Select **Add to topic** or **Remove from topic**
#. Click **Choose a topic**
#. Select an existing topic
#. Alternatively, click **Add New** to create a new `topic </users/crm/guides/programs/topics.html>`_ (this topic will automatically be chosen)
#. Click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** to display the topic that will be updated and if a contact will be added/removed

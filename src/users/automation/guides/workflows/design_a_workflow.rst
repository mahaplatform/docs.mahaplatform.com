Designing a Workflow
====================

| There are a lot of customizations available to create a unique workflow within the Maha Platform for the contacts enrolled in the workflow.
| Designing a workflow using the following steps allows you to edit an existing workflow.
| To create a new workflow, click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/new_workflow.html>`_ .

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Automation**
#. Click **Workflows**
#. Click on a workflow
#. Click **Design Workflow**
#. You can add a new block to your workflow by clicking and dragging the desired block (block explanations and guides hyperlinked below) to the workflow

   * `Send Message </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_message_block.html>`_ , `Ask Question </users/automation/guides/workflows/ask_question_block.html>`_ , `If/Then </users/automation/guides/workflows/if_then_block.html>`_ , `Wait </users/automation/guides/workflows/wait_block.html>`_ , `Set Goal </users/automation/guides/workflows/set_goal_block.html>`_ , `Set Variable </users/automation/guides/workflows/set_variable_block.html>`_ , `Time of Day </users/automation/guides/workflows/time_of_day_block.html>`_ , Update Property </users/automation/guides/workflows/update_property_block.html>`_ , `Update Consent </users/automation/guides/workflows/update_consent_block.html>`_ , `Update Lists </users/automation/guides/
   workflows/update_lists_block.html>`_ , `Enroll in Workflow </users/automation/guides/workflows/enroll_in_a_workflow_block.html>`_ , `Send Email </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_email_block.html>`_ , `Send SMS </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_sms_block.html>`_ , `Send Internal Email </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_internal_email_block.html>`_ , `Send Internal SMS </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_internal_sms_block.html>`_
   * Note that certain blocks are available only through certain workflows - for example, when designing the workflow in which a contact is enrolled through an SMS campaign, you are able to use the **Send Message** block
#. This will trigger a new tab where you can customize the block
#. To edit an already created block, hover over the block and click :icon:`pencil` and make changes in the tab
#. To duplicate a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`files-o`
#. To delete a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`trash-o`
#. To rearrange the blocks, drag the created blocks around the template
#. When you are satisfied with your workflow, click **Publish Version**.

   * To view your version history, click **Versions** and click on desired version
   * To restore a previous version of your workflow, click **Revert to Version**

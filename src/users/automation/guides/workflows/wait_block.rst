Wait Workflow Block
===================

| The **Wait** block allows an event to be triggered on a schedule - either upon a certain date or time, or once a designated amount of time has lapsed.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

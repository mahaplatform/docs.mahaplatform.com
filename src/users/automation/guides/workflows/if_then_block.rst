If/Then Block
=============

| The **If/Then** block allows for contacts enrolled in a workflow to follow separate pathways with different blocks. Contacts who satisfy your criteria follow one path and contacts who do not ("else") follow the other designated path.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Click **Save**

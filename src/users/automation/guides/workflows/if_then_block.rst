If/Then Workflow Block
======================

| The **If/Then** block allows for contacts enrolled in a workflow to follow separate pathways with different blocks. Contacts who satisfy your criteria follow one path and contacts who do not ("else") follow the other designated path.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Place an **If/Then** block in your workflow where desired

#. Click **Save**

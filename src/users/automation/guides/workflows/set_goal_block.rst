Workflows: Adding a Set Goal Block
==================================

| The **Set Goal** block allows you to mark a specific point in the workflow.
| When a contact reaches this set goal, it will be recorded and displayed in the performance tab - as a contact that has been "converted."
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place a **Set Goal** block in your workflow where desired

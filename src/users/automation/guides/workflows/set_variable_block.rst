Workflows: Adding a Set Variable Block
======================================

| The **Set Variable** block allows you to mark a specific point in the workflow.
| A contact who reaches this block will retain the variable - now a `token </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/tokens.html>`_ of the contact - as they move through the workflow.
| This memory allows for more complex if/then blocks to be implemented later on in the workflow.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place a **Set Variable** block in your workflow where desired

Workflows: Adding a Goto Menu Block
===================================

| The **Goto Menu** block is only available when designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_ or when managing a workflow for a `phone number </users/phone/guides/numbers/phone_numbers.html>`_ .
| To use this block, you must have added at least one menu option to a `dial menu block </users/automation/guides/workflows/dial_menu_block.html>`_ .
| This block allows you to redirect a caller/recipient to a destination - a forced routing to one of the menu options.

#. Place a **Goto Menu** block in your workflow where desired
#. Click **Choose a step**
#. Select the destination
#. Click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** to display menu ID

Emails: Adding a Web Version Block
==================================

| The **Web Version** block allows you to offer email recipients the ability to view the email in a browser if they experience display issues.
| This default version of this block usually suffices. The text is generally applicable and a link is already provided.
| If you'd like to edit this block, though, follow the steps below.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the email design tab. Refer to `Designing an Email </users/automation/guides/emails/design_email.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Place a **Web Version** block in your email where desired
#. If desired, change the default text by clicking and editing as needed

   * The hyperlink is connected to a web browser version of the email
   * You can use `tokens </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/tokens.html>`_ in your preferences block and customize the text using the icons in the first row
#. If desired, change the properties of the text in the **Style** tab
#. Click **Done**

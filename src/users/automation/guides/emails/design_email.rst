Designing an Email
==================

| When you create a `template </users/crm/guides/programs/templates.html>`_ , you will be given the option to design the email.
| There are a lot of customizations available to create a unique email within the Maha Platform for your contacts.
| You should have navigated to a pop-up tab to design your email. Refer to `Templates </users/crm/guides/programs/templates.html>`_ if you are having trouble doing so.

#. You can add a new `block </users/crm/guides/programs/email_design_blocks.html>`_ to your email by clicking and dragging the desired block under **Blocks** to the desired place in the email

   * To rearrange the blocks, drag the created blocks around the template
#. This will trigger a new tab entitled **Email** where you can customize the block
#. To edit an already created block, hover over the block and click :icon:`pencil` and make changes in the tab
#. To duplicate a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`files-o`
#. To delete a block, hover over the block and click :icon:`trash-o`
#. To see how your email will appear on a device, click the drop-down menu that shows your current display. Click **Desktop**, **Tablet**, or **Mobile** to switch the display mode

   * You can also change the display for your device as you edit in the two drop-down menus to the right: Change the orientation (Landscape and Portrait) and/or change the magnification (50%, 75%, or 100%)

#. Once satisfied, click **Save**
#. Click **Preview** to view a preview of your email. Choose to send it to your email linked to the Maha Platform, a specific user in the Maha Platform, or to someone outside of the organization, and then click **Send**

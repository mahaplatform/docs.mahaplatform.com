Automation
==========
The automation app lets users craft custom workflows for users that automate
some portion of the user's journey. Triggered by some external action (e.g.
responding to a form, clicking a link in an email, etc), users are enrolled in
a workflow and then passed through a series of steps that either alter their
customer record or send some sort of communication.

Drive: Moving a File or a Folder
================================

| **Moving Folders** and **Moving Files** allows you to move a folder along with the files it contains or a file to another location in your drive.
| When dealing with nested folders, you can only move a folder into another folder that is hierarchically equal to or higher than itself.
| This simply means you can not move a folder into a folder that is located within the folder you are going to move.
| If you are not seeing the desired folder as a location option, make sure the move you want to make complies with this rule.
| To move a folder or file, you must have navigated to the desired folder or file. Refer `here </users/drive/guides/managing_a_file.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

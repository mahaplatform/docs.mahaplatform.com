Drive: Managing a File or Folder
================================

| **Drive** offers teams a way to collectively store files in a hierarchical organization.
| To navigate the filesystem and manage a file or folder, follow the steps below.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Drive**
#. Click **My Drive** (or **Starred Items** if you have starred the file by clicking :icon:`star-o`)
#. If info tab is not displayed, click :icon:`info`
#. If desired, click :icon:`list` and :icon:`th` to change file/folder display
#. Click on the appropriate folders (you must click twice to display a folder's contents) until you have navigated to the desired file

   * Alternatively, `search </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/how_to_search.html>`_ for your file
   * While navigating through the folders, you will be given options for `interacting with the folder </users/drive/guides/interacting_with_a_file.html>`_ in the info tab under **Details**, along with `Access </users/drive/guides/check_access.html>`_, and (if you own the folder or can edit it) an audit trail under **Activity**
#. Click the file to show the file **Details** and `interaction options </users/drive/guides/interacting_with_a_file.html>`_, `Access </users/drive/guides/check_access.html>`_, and (if you own the file or can edit it) an audit trail under **Activity**

   * Alternatively, click :icon:`ellipsis-v` to view interaction options
#. Click the file again to view the file, details, and comments

   * Click :icon:`external-link` to open the file in a separate tab

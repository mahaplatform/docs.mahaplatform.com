Stores: Managing a Workflow through Automation
==============================================

| In :icon:`cogs` **Automation**, you can create new workflows and view and manage your existing workflows.
| A workflow for a store could be used in many ways - to thank a customer once they have placed an order, to notify them once their order has been shipped, etc.
| To manage the workflows of a store, you will need to have navigated to the store. Refer `here </users/stores/guides/managing_a_store.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Click :icon:`cogs` **Automation**
#. Click :icon:`plus` to create a new workflow

   * Select to trigger the workflow when the contact has placed an order or when the contact's order has been shipped
   * Enter a workflow title
   * Check the box if contacts can only be enrolled in the workflow once
   * Click **Save**
#. Click a workflow to view the details, associated emails, and performance of the workflow, as well as interact with the `workflow </users/automation/guides/workflows/workflows.html>`_ (refer to the hyperlink for available interactions)

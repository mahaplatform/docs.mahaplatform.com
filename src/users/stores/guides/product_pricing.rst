| You have a couple of options when creating the prices for your products (and their variants, if applicable) - you can set a fixed price, allow customers to pay what they can afford, or even offer a product for free.
| To price the products of a store, you will need to create a new product or edit the variant(s) of an already existing product. Refer `here </users/stores/guides/products.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

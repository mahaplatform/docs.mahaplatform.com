Changing Event Notifications
============================

.. note::
   Generally, the Maha Platform will try to deliver notifications by sending an in app notification, then a push notification, and finally by sending an email.

   An in app notification will notify you when an event occurs while you are actively using the Maha platform but on a page unrelated to the notification. If you are not on the Maha Platform or your page is inactive, a push notification will be sent. If neither notification methods are successful, the Maha Platform will notify you via email.

   However, you can customize your notification preferences by disabling certain notification methods on a per event basis. You can have different notification preferences for specific events, as well.

#. Click on your profile (a circle with your initials or profile picture) at the bottom of the ribbon on the left hand of the screen
#. Click **Manage Notifications**
#. Click **Manage Events**
#. Deselect the notification(s) you do not want delivered by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> **check icon** next to the notification method (in-app, push, or email)
   * Note that this disables this notification method for this specific event only
*. Click **Save**

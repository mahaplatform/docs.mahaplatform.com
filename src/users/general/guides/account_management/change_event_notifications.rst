Account Management: Changing Event Notifications
================================================

| Generally, the Maha Platform will try to deliver notifications by sending an in app notification, then a push notification, and finally by sending an email.
| An in app notification will notify you when an event occurs while you are actively using the Maha platform but on a page unrelated to the notification.
| If you are not on the Maha Platform or your page is inactive, a push notification will be sent.
| If neither notification methods are successful, the Maha Platform will notify you via email.
| However, you can customize your notification preferences by disabling certain notification methods on a per event basis.
| You can have different notification preferences for specific events, as well.

#. Click on your profile (a circle with your initials or profile picture) located in the ribbon

#. Deselect the notification(s) you do not want delivered by clicking on the :icon:`check-circle` next to the notification method (in-app, push, or email)

   * Note that this disables this notification method for this specific event only
#. Click **Save**

How To Filter Records
=====================

.. note::
   When searching for certain results in a large database or finding results that satisfy a given condition, it can be advantageous to filter the records.

   For example, if you wanted to know which events were being hosted by a certain organization, you could apply a filter.

   Some systems have built in filters under **System Filters**. These will automatically be displayed. Sometimes, you can apply these system filters and/or apply your own under **Your filters**.

   You should navigate to the page that contains the results you wish to filter using the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> **menu icon** in the ribbon.

#. Click the <i class="fa fa-filter"></i> **filter icon** in the upper left hand corner of the page
#. Click on a criteria category under **Filter Results** (`eg. _status_`)
#. Click on a specific criteria under this aspect to apply a specific filter (`eg. approved`)
   * You can also use the search feature to find a specific criteria
#. If available, you can click **+ New Filter** under **Your Filters** to create your own filter
#. Click **+ADD CRITERIA**
#. If desired, select a **conditional**
   * `AND </users/finance/guides/functions_of_the_grid/filter_and.html>`_: to be shown a result, it must satisfy both of the filters you apply
   * `OR </users/finance/guides/functions_of_the_grid/filter_or.html>`_: to be shown a result, it must satisfy at least one of the filters you apply
 #. Inspect results that have satisfied your filter(s) by clicking on each result. Associated information will be displayed
 #. Select desired result(s) and choose an option
    * Add to Lists: Select all lists to which you want to add the selected results. Click **Save**
    * Add to Topics: Select all topics to which you want to add the selected results. Click **Save**
 #. If desired, `save filter </users/finance/guides/functions_of_the_grid/save.filter.html>`_

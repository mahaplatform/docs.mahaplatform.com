Display/Hide Elements
================

.. note::
   When displaying data, most rows have many columns that identify or describe. Not all of these columns will automatically be shown. For example, IDs must manually be chosen to be displayed.

   If you do not want to see certain columns, you can hide (as well as display) them using the following steps.

   A <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i> **lock icon** indicates the column is invariable. This column is essential and must be displayed at all times.

   You should navigate to the page that contains the data for which you wish to change the column display using the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> **menu icon** in the ribbon.

#. Click the <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i> **arrow icon** in the top right hand corner of the page
#. Click a blank column name to add it displayed columns

   * A <i class="fa fa-check"></i> **green check** next to the column name will appear, indicating that it is currently displayed
#. Click a column name with a <i class="fa fa-check"></i> **green check** to hide the column

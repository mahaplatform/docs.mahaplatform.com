Chat: Creating a New Conversation
=================================

| To start a chat conversation with another user of your team directly through the Maha Platform, follow the steps below.
| Note that these conversations are private, strictly between you and the users you have selected. This is different from `commenting </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/comment.html>`_, which allows you to leave public messages on pages.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon
#. Click **Chat**

   * Alternatively, click :icon:`comment` in the ribbon to pull up **Chat** in a side bar
#. Click :icon:`plus` in the blue ribbon
#. Select the user(s) with whom you would like to chat
#. Click **Start**
#. You can now leave a `message </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/comment.html>`_

   * The guide to commenting (linked right above) is almost identical to this messaging feature - but, with **Chat** you can not delete your messages

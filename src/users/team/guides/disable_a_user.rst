Users: Disabling a User
=======================

| When a user is leaving your team or is otherwise no longer needed as a user on the Maha Platform, you can disable their account.
| When you disable a user, you will need to decide if their roles and memberships will remain intact and what will happen to their files and folders.
| This is a reversible action - so opting to retain this data could be helpful for temporarily disabling a user.

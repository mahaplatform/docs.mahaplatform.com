| **Call Logs** keeps a record of all the inbound calls that happen through the Maha Program.
| It keeps track of who the call was **To** (a user/program and the associated number) and who the call was **From** (the initiator of the call (displayed as **Unknown** if the number is not connected to a contact) and the associated number).
| The date and time of the call pickup is displayed along with the call status. Most will be **Completed**, though if you catch an ongoing call, it might say **Ringing**

Users: Interacting with a User That Has Not Been Activated
==========================================================

| Once a user is created, an activation email is sent to their email address.
| Until the user activates their account, they will be considered unactivated.
| If a user still displays the message "This user hasn't yet activated their account", you can consider sending another activation email.
| Refer to `Users </users/team/guides/users.html>`_ for a complete guide on managing a user.

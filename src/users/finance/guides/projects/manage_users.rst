Managing Users
==============

.. note::
   You should have navigated to the pop-up tab entitled **Manage users**. Refer to `Projects </users/general/guides/projects/project_general.html>`_ if you are having trouble navigating to this page.

   Users belonging to a project are to be assigned one of three roles. Users will be a member by default. Actions taken by a member and an owner, such as submitting an expense, will be supervised by the project's approver(s). Actions taken by the approver are reviewed by the project's owner. This system allows all actions to be preliminarily reviewed and approved by another user belonging to the project.

#. Select a user from the displayed names, or find a user using the search feature. Click the user to add them to your project.

   * By default, this newly added user will be a member
#. Change status by clicking the colored box to the right of the users name

   * Click through three options (Member, Approver, and Owner) until the displayed option matches what role you would like to assign the user
#. Click the <i class="fa fa-times"></i> **icon** to the right of the users row to remove the user from the project

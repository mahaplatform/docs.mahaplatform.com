Display/Hide Elements
================

.. note::
   When displaying data, some data has many elements. Not all of these elements will automatically be shown. For example, IDs must manually be chosen to be displayed.

   If a user does not want to see certain elements, they can hide (as well as display) them using the following steps. Though if an element is locked, it is invariable.

   Users should navigate to the page that contains the data for which they wish to change element display using the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> **menu icon** in the ribbon.

#. Click the <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i> **arrow icon** in the top right hand corner of the page
#. Click the element

Inbound SMS: Interacting with an Inbound SMS Campaign
=====================================================

| Inbound messaging starts with an individual sending a `trigger term </users/campaigns/guides/inbound_sms/trigger_term.html>`_ to a program's number.
| This will enroll them in the SMS campaign's workflow.
| If this individual has an unknown phone number (meaning it is not associated with any contact in the Maha Platform), the Caller Identification service will search for a name to create a new contact.

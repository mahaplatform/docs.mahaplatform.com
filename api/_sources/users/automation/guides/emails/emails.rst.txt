Emails: Interacting with an Email
=================================

| You can not create an email directly through **Automation**. Rather, **Emails** keeps a record of emails that have been created, and allows you to design/edit these existing emails.
| You can create a new email through other sections of the Maha Platform, such as `templates </users/crm/guides/programs/templates.html>`_

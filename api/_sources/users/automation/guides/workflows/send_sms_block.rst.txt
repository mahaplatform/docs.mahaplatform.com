Send SMS Workflow Block
=======================

| The **Send SMS** block allows you to send a text message to a contact's phone number.
| This block is used to send a notification to the contact enrolled in the workflow. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/send_internal_sms_block.html>`_ to notify someone internally (within your organization).
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.
| Note that if the intended recipient does not have a phone number, they will be unenrolled from the workflow and labeled as "lost."

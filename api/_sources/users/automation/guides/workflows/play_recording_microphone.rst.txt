Workflows: Recording Audio with Your Microphone
===============================================

| When you are designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_, you can add a `Play Audio block </users/automation/guides/workflows/play_recording_block.html>`_. 
| The **Play Recording** block gives you the option to record audio.
| One of the ways you can do this is by recording your voice on your device, as described below.
| If this is your first time recording audio, a pop-up tab will appear in your browser requesting permission to record. Make sure to click **allow**.

#. Click **Microphone**
#. Click **Start Recording**
#. When finished recording, click **Stop Recording**
#. To listen to your audio, click :icon:`play`
#. To adjust your volume, hover over :icon:`volume-up` and click or drag the sliding scale to desired volume level

   * Click :icon:`volume-up` to mute sound entirely
#. To record again, you will have to delete your current audio recording, by clicking :icon:`times` and repeating previous steps
#. When satisfied with audio recording, click **Done**

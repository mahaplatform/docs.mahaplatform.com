Update Consent Block
====================

| The **Update Consent** block allows you to change the consent status of a contact - by adding or removing their consent for one of the methods of communication.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to a workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ to do so from **Automation**. Refer to **Campaign** and **Phone** guides for other workflows.

#. Place an **Update Consent** block in your workflow where desired
#. Select **Add Consent** or **Remove Consent**
#. Select a channel - **Email**, **Voice**, **SMS**, or **Postal**
#. Click **Done**
#. In the workflow, you can now click **show more** to display the channel that will be updated (depending what your workflow is for - voice, sms, etc) and if consent will be given or revoked (opt in/out)

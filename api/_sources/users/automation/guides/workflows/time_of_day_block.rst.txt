Workflows: Adding a Time of Day Block
=====================================

| The **Time of Day** block is available when designing a workflow for a `voice campaign </users/campaigns/guides/voice/voice_campaigns.html>`_, an `inbound SMS campaign </users/campaigns/guides/inbound_sms/inbound_sms_campaigns.html>`_, an `outbound SMS campaign </users/campaigns/guides/outbound_sms/outbound_sms_campaigns.html>`_, or when managing a workflow for a `phone number </users/phone/guides/numbers/phone_numbers.html>`_.
| This block allows you to offer a certain path in the workflow when it is reached during a certain window of time (for example, 9AM to 5PM on weekdays) and another path for all other times ("else").

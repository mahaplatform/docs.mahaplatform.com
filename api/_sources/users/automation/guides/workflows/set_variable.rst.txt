Set Variable Block
==================

| The **Set Variable** block allows you to mark a specific point in the workflow.
| A contact who reaches a set variable will retain this variable - now a `token </users/general/guides/functions_of_the_grid/tokens.html>`_ of the contact - as they move through the workflow.
| This memory allows for more complex if/then blocks to be implemented later on in the workflow.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/emails/design_email.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Place a **Set Variable** block in your workflow where desired
#. Enter a name
#. Enter a value
#. Click **Done**

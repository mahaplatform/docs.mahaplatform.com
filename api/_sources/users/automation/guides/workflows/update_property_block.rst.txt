Update Property Workflow Block
==============================

| The **Update Property** Block allows you to add (or change) a property of a contact.
| This block gives you the option to update contact properties and/or custom properties, depending from where you are designing your workflow (manually, from a program, etc).
| In practice, updating contact properties will not happen naturally or often. Instead, this feature is most useful for updating custom properties. You will be able to update `properties </users/crm/guides/programs/properties.html>`_ that have been previously added.
| To use this block, you will need to have navigated to the workflow design tab. Click `here </users/automation/guides/workflows/design_a_workflow.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

#. Place an **Update Property** block in your workflow where desired
#. Click **Choose a property**
#. Select a property
#. Enter a value
#. If you would like contacts who already have a property value to take on this property value instead, check the box entitled **Overwrite value if property is already set**
#. Click **Done**

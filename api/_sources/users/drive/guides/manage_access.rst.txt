Drive: Managing the Access of a File
====================================

| **Manage Access** allows you to change which users have access to your files and the degree of access these users have.
| You are the owner of the files unless you have `transferred their ownership </users/drive/guides/transfer_ownership.html>`_ another user.
| The other access privileges are viewing files and editing files (which includes viewing).
| Note that **Drive** is a hierarchical organization of files and the change to access of one file or folder will be applied to all files and folders below it.
| To manage the access of a file, you must have navigated to the desired file. Refer to `Managing a File or Folder </users/drive/guides/managing_a_file.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

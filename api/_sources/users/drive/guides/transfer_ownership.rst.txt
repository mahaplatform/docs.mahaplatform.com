Drive: Transferring Ownership of the Maha Drive
================================================

| Transferring ownership allows you to move all the files in one user's drive to the drive of another user.
| This could be useful if, for example, a member of your team is retiring but you still want to keep all their files within your team.
| If you would simply like to share a specific file with another user, refer to `Sharing a File </users/drive/guides/share_file.html>`_ instead.

Projects: Managing Members
==========================

| You should have navigated to the pop-up tab entitled **Manage Users**. Refer to `Projects </users/general/guides/projects/project_general.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.
| Users belonging to a project are to be assigned one of three roles. Users will be a member by default, though can also be an owner or an approver.
| Such a membership system allows all actions to be preliminarily reviewed and approved by another user belonging to the project.
| Actions taken by a member and an owner, such as submitting an expense, will be supervised by the project's approver(s).
| Actions taken by the approver are reviewed by the project's owner.

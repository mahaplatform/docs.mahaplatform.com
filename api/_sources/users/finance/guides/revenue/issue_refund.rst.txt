Revenue: Issuing a Refund to a Customer
=======================================

| When a customer mistakenly makes a purchase or is otherwise unhappy with their purchase, they can request a refund.
| When you issue a refund, you have a few options to customize it. You can pay back the full amount straight to their account, but you can also refund only a percentage of what they payed, and/or offer them a customer credit instead.

#. Enter a reason for the refund
#. Select the product(s) from the customer's order which you would like to refund
#. Select **Card Refund**/**PayPal Refund** (refund money back to the credit card/PayPal account used to make the purchase) or **Customer Credit** (refund money to a customer credit - the customer can make a new purchase with the refunded money)
#. Select to pay the balance or to pay another amount

   * For the second option, enter the amount you will refund
#. Click **Save**

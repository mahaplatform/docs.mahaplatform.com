How To Filter Records
=====================

.. note::
   When searching for certain results in a large database or finding results that satisfy a given condition, it can be advantageous to filter the records.

   For example, if a user wanted to know which events were being hosted by a certain organization, they could apply a filter.

   Users should navigate to the page that contains the results they wish to filter using the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> **menu icon** in the ribbon.

#. Click the <i class="fa fa-filter"></i> **filter icon** in the upper left hand corner of the page
#. Click on an aspect under **Filter Results** (`eg. status`)
#. Click on a specific filter option under this aspect to apply a specific filter (`eg. approved`)

   * Each filter clicked will remain while on this page until removed
   * Click the same aspect to remove the filter

Stores: Managing the Categories of a Store
==========================================

| **Categories** displays the categories of a store - each row has a category name and the number of products in the category.
| When a customer views a store, you can offer them the option to filter the products by category (e.g. snack, beverage, dessert).
| To do so, you must create these categories, by following the steps below. Refer to `Adding a Product to a Store </users/stores/guides/products.html>`_ to add a product to a category.
| To manage the categories of a store, you will need to have navigated to the store. Refer to `Stores </users/stores/guides/stores.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

Stores: Managing the Fields of a Store

| **Fields** are the details that will be requested of a customer when they are beginning the checkout process.
| By default, you must have **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email Address** as fields. These fields are invariable and can not be deleted or edited.
| To manage the fields of a store, you will need to have navigated to the store. Refer to `Stores </users/stores/guides/stores.html>`_ if you are having trouble reaching this point.

Phone: Viewing the Call Log
===========================

| **Call Logs** keeps a record of all the inbound calls that happen through the Maha Program.
| It keeps track of who the call was **To** (a user/program and the associated number) and who the call was **From** (the initiator of the call (displayed as **Unknown** if the number is not connected to a contact) and the associated number).
| The date and time of the call pickup is displayed along with the call status. Most will be **Completed**, though if you catch an ongoing call, it will say **Ringing**.

#. Click :icon:`bars` in the ribbon

#. Click **Call Logs**
#. Click a call log to view call details
#. In addition to the previously displayed **To**, **From**, and **Status**, you can now see the **Price** and **Duration** (in seconds) of the call
